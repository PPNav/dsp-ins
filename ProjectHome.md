The open source project DSP\_INS is an inertial navigation system on the TI DSP platform TMS320F28335 with MEMS inertial sensors and commercial GPS module. Inertial sensors are actually used only for estimating attitude, heading and velocity. Position information totally comes from GPS. Currently the MEMS IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) ADIS16355 and GPS module u-blox LEA-5H are supported. DSP\_INS also reads magnetic field data from HONEYWELL HMC1051/1052. You can also use the IMU module ADIS16405, which integrates magnetic field sensors.

There is a 10-order extended Kalman filter in DSP\_INS, which takes angular velocity, acceleration, magnetic field, and GPS velocity as inputs. It provides outputs including angular velocity, acceleration, attitude, heading, velocity, and position (from GPS) every 10 milliseconds. DSP\_INS is proved to be effective and reliable in several robot and unmanned aerial vehicle projects. Many robots using DSP\_INS or its previous versions as the measurement unit have been developed and deployed in the past several years.
